# Decision-Aware Stochastic Consumption Forecasting Under Covariate Scarcity

This project explores stochastic inventory forecasting under severe covariate scarcity using Poisson–Gamma conjugacy and a waste-constrained restocking policy.

A concise methods note summarizing the modeling approach, decision logic, and empirical findings is available here:

Key takeaways:
- Uncertainty modeling revealed structural complexity in real consumption processes.
- Model and decision-rule assumptions were insufficient for consistent decision-grade forecasting.
- Expert oversight and communication outperformed automated inventory control under nonstationarity.
